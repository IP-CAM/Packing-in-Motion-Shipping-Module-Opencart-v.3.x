# OpenCart package in motion - shipping module
I present to you my proprietary shipping module package to OpenCarta version 3.0. The module can be used for commercial purposes.

# Installation
Download Zip package to your OpenCart version and install it using the installer built into OpenCart

# Support
The module has been shared for free, so we ask all of its users about voluntary financial support. Thanks to your donations, I will continue to develop this and other free modules for OpenCart.

# Possible problems
If after installation, descriptions are missing, copy the translation files of Language / en-en / exttension / shipping to the correct directory in your store.
